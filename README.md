# Mandelbrot
Implementation of the Mandelbrot set in Java Processing using the ControlP5 library. The program also includes display of the corresponding Julia set, zoom functionality, reset and grid/axes functionality, as well as drawing iterations and choosing color palettes. It also has the functionality of changing the number of iterations and jumping to special locations on the Mandelbrot set.

Some of the features are inspired by https://mandel.gart.nz and [What's so special about the Mandelbrot Set? - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk).
